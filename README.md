# Tic Tac Toe Application

## Application
Assignment for Application Development I during Winter 2022 semester. Refactored code from [Sandy Bultena](https://github.com/sandy-bultena "Sandy Bultena GitHub") into MVP architectural pattern, designed Tic Tac Toe user interface and added extra features such as selecting player icon, and wrote presenter unit tests. The application allows 2 users to play a tic tac toe game. Upon starting the application, the user is able to enter a settings page or start a new game. In the settings page, the user is able to select an icon for the first and second player. Once the player begins a new game, the game alternates between prompting each player to select a tile. The turns continue until their is either a tie or one of the players win.
